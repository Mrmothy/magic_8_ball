# This is a Magic 8-Ball Question Game.

## A functional question and answer game that when a question is asked the computer will generate a number and print out a magic 8-ball with it's response.  

This program is uses some example code in a project from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python) Learn Python 3. This program is a sample code which shows how to use the following:

- Using the import random module
- Getting the users input 
- Using if/elif/else statement 
- Using some inspiration from [ASCII art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art)

##  How to use this program on your own
I'd encourage you to clone and use this program in whatever IDE you feel comfortable using. 

After each run on the terminal I would use the command clear so there is no issue with the ball rendering.
